Hustle adds `(cons a b)` and `(box v)`, which are both allocated on the heap.

- The C main function now allocates a bunch of memory for the heap and passes the pointer to that to the `entry` function.
- `entry` stores the heap pointer in **`rbx`** (`rbx` holds pointer to next free memory).

Every time you want to allocate more memory from the heap, just add 8 to `rbx`.

## How to differentiate between different kinds of pointers?

We know that pointers in both the stack and heap will always be 8-byte/64-bit aligned,
meaning they end in `000` in binary.

- So now, immediate values (everything except `cons` and `box`) will use `000` for the 3 least significant bits
  - The bits to the left of that will determine whether it's an int, boolean, etc., just like before
  - Now only have 60 bits left for integers
    - 3 bits used for immediate tag (`000`)
    - 1 bit used for type tag
- `box`es will have `001` for their least significant bits
- `cons` will have `010` for their least significant bits

> [!WARNING]
> The last 3 bits for `cons` and `box` will have to be zeroed out before using them as pointers.
